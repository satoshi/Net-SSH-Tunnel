Net-SSH-Tunnel

Net::SSH::Tunnel is a simple wrapper around ssh to establish a tunnel.
Supports both local and remote port forwarding.

You'd need to create a very short script like below, and invoke it.
Command line options are parsed inside the module.
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use Net::SSH::Tunnel;

Net::SSH::Tunnel->run();

# run the driver script with options.
$ ./driver.pl --host dest.example.com --hostname hostname.example.com
    
# the above is equivalent to creating a local port forwarding like this:
# ssh -f -N -L 10000:dest.example.com:22 <effective username>@hostname.example.com

# after the driver script is done, you can then do:
ssh -p 10000 user@localhost
